                    <p>    
                    From Memphis, TN, my roots are in the Delta. With a history so rich in music, it's no wonder I ended
                    up learning the drums at an early age. I played in groups touring the country most of my teenage and early 
                    adult life before pursuing many other interests. While I still produce music and play 
                    on recording sessions, I have dabbled in woodworking and production design in the tv/film 
                    industry and have most recently turned my professional focus to software and web development. I'm attending 
                    A fullstack bootcamp at Vanderbilt to gain and perfect my skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>Interestly, I am co-founder of a music software and hardware start-up here in Nashville that is focusing 
                    on the development and launch of a product called SynthTable. Essentially, the software turns any digital 
                    turntable into a synthesizer and any respective DJ into a musician. It should prove to change music once it hits 
                    the market.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    To Be Continued.
