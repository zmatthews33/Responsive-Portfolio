      <img src="assets/images/biopic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Zach Matthews">

      <p>    
        From Memphis, TN, my roots are in the Delta. With a history so rich in music, it's no wonder I ended
        up learning the drums at an early age. I played in groups touring the country most of my teenage and early 
        adult life before pursuing many other interests. While I still produce music and play 
        on recording sessions, I have dabbled in woodworking and production design in the tv/film 
        industry and have most recently turned my professional focus to software and web development. I'm attending 
        A fullstack bootcamp at Vanderbilt to gain and perfect my skills.
        </p>
        <p>Interestly, I am co-founder of a music software and hardware start-up here in Nashville that is focusing 
        on the development and launch of a product called SynthTable. Essentially, the software turns any digital 
        turntable into a synthesizer and any respective DJ into a musician. It should prove to change music once it hits 
        the market.

        <p>
        To Be Continued.
